    "ANS- A database is a collection of organized data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It is used to store \n",
    "     information that can be retrieved and analyzed by software applications. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.SQL databases, also known as relational databases, are structured databases that use a tabular format to store data in rows and columns. \n",
    "  They use SQL (Structured Query Language) to interact with the database, which is a standardized language used for managing relational databases. \n",
    "    SQL databases are ideal for storing structured data, such as financial data or customer information, because the relationships between \n",
    "    data are clearly defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a variety of ways, such as document-based, key-value, \n",
    "  column-family, or graph databases. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data that doesn't \n",
    "    fit neatly into a traditional relational database. NoSQL databases are often used for web applications, social media, and other \n",
    "    applications that require high scalability and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases is their data model. SQL databases use a rigid, predefined schema that \n",
    "determines the structure of the data, while NoSQL databases are schema-less, meaning they can accommodate a variety of data structures \n",
    "without a predefined schema. Additionally, SQL databases are generally better suited for complex queries and transactions, \n",
    "while NoSQL databases are better suited for fast, simple queries and high scalability."
